"""Spectral helpers: finding the physiological peaks in a motion signal.

A body-worn accelerometer on someone standing still picks up two rhythms that are not
movement in the intentional sense. Respiration sits at roughly 0.2-0.4 Hz and the
ballistocardiac impulse, the recoil of the heart ejecting blood, at roughly 0.8-1.8 Hz.
Both are inside or adjacent to the micromotion band, so isolating postural motion means
locating them first.
